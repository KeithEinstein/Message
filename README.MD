### Pain Points

1. Being Sloppy - In the beginning, I was trying to build out my base code as quickly as possible to get started and I named my database chat when I created it in the terminal, while I named it project_2 in the db/index.js file so I was stuck for hours not understanding why I couldn't seed my database. 
2. Understanding Cross Model Controllers - I thought a controller could only speak to its model and figured out that in fact you as long as you require other models in it, your able to have a controller call two different models in the same router. 
3. Flexbox and Grid - Just not good at CSS yet.

### Feature Roadmap

1. Add the ability to create other users and allow them to buy a Twilio phone number.
2. Condensce the contacts and messages screens into one screen so it's easier to switch contacts and send messages.
3. Add the ability for contacts to reply to your messages for a full chat capability.
4. Add group chat.
